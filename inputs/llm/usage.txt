Modernity has promoted global trading policies as economic reforms tools. Thus, against the backdrop of underdeveloped nations, the "Everything But Arms" (EBA) initiative marks a landmark in strategies to be applied to leveling the international trade conditions for LDCs. The EBA, organized by the EU, seeks to inter alia offer all products from LDCs a quota-free, duty-free trade access, save the arms and ammunition. At the core of this approach is the belief that being able to access preferential markets emerges as a strategy that is in a position to foster growth, bring diversity into the export list, and, in the end, make global economic upliftment a reality. A short term effect on the life of local apparel industry, formed one of the most important bases for their economic growth, is a negative impact of such trade privileges. With these nations trying to locate their space on the world markets, policies like the EBA are seen as the “sign of light” on the way towards success. While it is undeniable that the complexity of the trade models and the sheer number of competitors of this kind of policy present uncertainty about the effectiveness of these trade measures. The research that is described here tries to step beyond the microeconomic studies of firm-level impact in Bangladesh (like the original journal article reported) to the scrutiny of the macroeconomic connotations of EBA use in the global market of apparel products. To start, the policy of trade and its core aim about the economic development is clearly defined by outlining the circumstances in which the LDC apparel industry takes place. Then, it goes on the longest journey in the apparel industry across the world visiting the competitors, government policies and the market shares. By portraying the relationship between emerging economies and mature manufacturing giants particularly China in a complicated and deep way, the article intends to make clear the role of these economies in trade. Through the application of a macroeconomic perspective, this paper is purposefully designed to disentangle the wider narratives that are implicit in trade policy based on preferred partnerships. It casts light on how the shifts in EBAs rates are reflected in the competition relations between LDCs and China, and whether these EBAs have any meaningful effect on the global market distribution. The pivotal factor is the introduction of data covering nearly two decades of economic life, which supply a longitudinal view of how the economy has been unfolding. Other than the analytical approach used, the study also thinks about how policy issues affect broader trade relations. It entails the questioning of critical factors faced by LDCs, the tenacity of the growth strategies in the face of global trade, and the substantial outcomes brought by market access preferences. This introduction will establish the initial frameworks, and following sections will focus more carefully on the data, unwind the discoveries, and hold a conversation on implications, limitations, and future ways that can be found based on the analysis.

Modernity has promoted global trading policies as tools for economic reform. The "Everything But Arms" (EBA) initiative, organized by the EU, stands out as a landmark strategy aimed at leveling international trade conditions for Least Developed Countries (LDCs). The EBA offers all products from LDCs quota-free, duty-free access to trade, with the exception of arms and ammunition. This approach aims to foster growth, diversify export lists, and promote global economic upliftment. However, there are short-term negative impacts on local apparel industries, which are crucial for the economic growth of many LDCs. Despite uncertainties surrounding the effectiveness of such trade measures due to complex trade models and numerous competitors, the research described here seeks to move beyond microeconomic studies to scrutinize the macroeconomic implications of EBA in the global apparel market. The article outlines the circumstances of the LDC apparel industry, explores global competition, government policies, and market shares. By examining the relationship between emerging economies and manufacturing giants like China, it aims to clarify their roles in trade. Through a macroeconomic perspective and longitudinal data spanning nearly two decades, the study aims to unravel broader narratives implicit in trade policy preferences, particularly concerning competition between LDCs and China and their impact on global market distribution. The research also considers how policy issues affect broader trade relations, addressing critical factors faced by LDCs, growth strategies amidst global trade dynamics, and the outcomes of market access preferences. This introduction establishes the initial framework, with subsequent sections delving into data analysis, discoveries, and discussions on implications, limitations, and future directions based on the analysis.

Grammar errors:

"Modernity has promoted global trading policies as tools for economic reform." (Replace "tools" with "tool").
"Thus, against the backdrop of underdeveloped nations, the 'Everything But Arms' (EBA) initiative marks a landmark in strategies applied to level international trade conditions for LDCs." (Awkward phrasing; consider rephrasing for clarity).
"Then, it embarks on the longest journey in the apparel industry worldwide, visiting competitors, government policies, and market shares." (The phrase "the longest journey" may be unclear in this context).
Lack of clarity:

Some sentences are overly complex and convoluted, making it difficult for the reader to grasp the intended meaning.
The transition between different points could be smoother to improve overall coherence and flow.
Redundancy:

Some sentences repeat similar ideas, leading to redundancy and unnecessarily lengthy passages.
Repetitive use of certain phrases and terms, such as "macroeconomic perspective" and "global market distribution," could be reduced.
Ambiguity:

Certain statements, such as "policies like the EBA are seen as a 'sign of light' on the path towards success," are vague and lack specificity.
The intended purpose or objective of the research could be clarified to provide a clearer understanding of its scope and goals.

Make sure no error in code
ChatGPT
Your code seems to be written mostly in R, but there are a few syntax errors and inconsistencies that need to be addressed:

In the ldc_only calculation, there's a mix of pipe (|>) and standard dplyr syntax (%>%). Please use consistent syntax. Since you're already using %>% throughout your script, replace |> with %>%.

In the ldc_only calculation, there's an incorrect usage of the pipe operator (|>). This operator is not valid in R. You should use %>% instead.

In the ldc_only calculation, the usage of summarise might throw an error as it seems to expect aggregate functions for both util and var. If you want to calculate the mean and standard deviation, you should use summarise twice for each calculation separately.

In the write_csv function calls, you have incorrect file paths specified for output files. Make sure the directory paths are accurate.

In the comments, you have mentioned the license as "MIT," but it's not clear whether you're referring to the license for the code or the data. Ensure clarity in your comments.

Here's the corrected version of the relevant sections:

R
Copy code
ldc_only <- util %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(util = mean(frac), var = sd(frac))

write_csv(ldc_only, "/cloud/project/outputs/data/ldc_only.csv")

# Plot Figure 3 (Market Share)
# Read in the market share data (update the path as needed)
market_share <- read_csv("/cloud/project/inputs/data/market_share.csv")

write_csv(market_share, "/cloud/project/outputs/data/market_share_data.csv")

# Prepare data for plotting
bgd <- util %>%
  filter(PARTNER_LAB == "BANGLADESH") %>%
  group_by(year, woven) %>%
  summarise(gsp_value = sum(gsp_value), value = sum(value)) %>%
  mutate(frac = gsp_value / value)

write_csv(bgd, "/cloud/project/outputs/data/bgd.csv")
Ensure that you update the file paths according to your directory structure. Also, double-check the data manipulation steps to ensure they are correctly achieving the intended outcomes.
